      <description>census_api_key(“37c38f3d2e15304bd682b2fb6da6dd87df896430”, install = T, overwrite = T)   I just realized that I have lived in Columbus Metropolitan area for more than ten years. How time flies! In these years, I saw more and more people, buildings and vehicles. No doubt this city is growing dramatically. But I found almost all my quantitative understanding of Columbus is from Wiki…It is not bad, but what if I want to know more about this city?</description>

At the beginning, a data set with missing and duplicated values were simulated. This data set was also saved to the feather format, which can be consumed by Python, too.</description>
