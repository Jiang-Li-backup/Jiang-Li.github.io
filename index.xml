      <description>Data and Methods GLM GLM tweedie Random Forest GBM   Insurance models predict risk, which is usually represented by pure premium; i.e., the incurred loss normalized by exposure, for example, the earned car year. GLM (Generalized Linear Model) is the most popular method mostly because the results are interpretable. In the insurance modeling, the variation of response could be nonlinear and very complicated. I am curious that how how this complexity can be well caught by GLM’s logarithm link function.</description>

      <description>There is a moe column in the census data pulled using the tidycensus. After doing a mini research on it, I learned that actually this variable is the 90% confidence interval for the population mean. Yihui said “Listen / read / talk and forget; write and remember!”, so I guess it it better to write down something quickly before I forgot it.
When the population mean, \(\mu\), is estimated, it is more meaningful to use an interval that represents the probable range.</description>

      <description>Where the story is from How to get Census data Explore the columbus area   Where the story is from Until 2018 I have lived in Columbus Metropolitan area for more than ten years. How time flies! In these years I feel more and more vehicles on the road. No doubt this area is growing fast. However, almost all my quantitative understanding of Columbus is from Wiki…It is not bad, but what if I want to know more?</description>

      <description>Row and Column Missing Values Unique Frequency Aggregation Merge Reshape   I often use R, Python, SAS, SQL, and Bash in different tasks at the same time. To make the switch between different languages easier, I built a list of the commonly-used script for a quick reference.
A simulated sample data set with missing values and duplicated values was used. The reticulate package was used to call R data from Phthon.</description>
